The program is similar to the popular game "wordle". One user will enter a 5 letter word into the program. Then, the other user will 
begin to guess what that word is by entering their own 5 letter words. For each individual word guessed, if the user guessed the correct letter in the correct spot, 
the character "[]" will show up in that spot. If the user guessed the correct letter, but in the wrong spot, the character "{}"
will show up in that spot. If a letter is guessed that is not in the word, then the character "_" will show up in that spot. The 
user will then use that output to help them continue to guess the word until they get it correct. 

To complete this project, the three of us arranged a time to meet up outside of class and together we all worked as a group to write 
the code, while bouncing ideas off of each other and taking it step by step.
